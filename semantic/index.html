            <p title="About Pav Bhaji">Pav bhaji is an iconic dish from Mumbai, which is also hugely popular as street food all over India. It first came into picture in Mumbai as a quick lunch option for textile mill workers. It is a typical Maharashtrian spice powder which is easily available in Indian stores and online. But, with the above linked recipe, it can be easily made at home.This masala powder is an absolutely essential ingredient in the Pav Bhaji Recipe as you can only achieve the most authentic and perfect flavor by using the pav bhaji masala in it.</p>

                <h1>Ingredient List For Pav Bhaji Recipe:</h1>
                <ul title="Ingredient For Pav Bhaji Recipe">
                    <li><b>Mixed Vegetables:</b> I use vegetables like potatoes, capsicum, carrot, cauliflower, green peas. The street side versions do not have carrots and may also add less/no cauliflower. However, I add to make the bhaji more nutritious and homely.</li>
                    <li><b>Green Peas:</b> I mostly use fresh or frozen green peas, whereas dried green or white peas are used in the street side bhajis. These are cooked and mashed. This also results in a different taste and consistency of the bhaji. You can also make it with dried green peas.</li>
                    <li><b>Pav Bhaji Masala:</b> This dish will lose its essence if there is no pav bhaji masala in it. So, you can use a good branded readymade pav bhaji masala or use your homemade one.</li>
                    <li><b>Butter:</b>   For the bhaji, my preference has always been the Indian brand of Amul butter. But you can even use any other trusted brand or homemade butter</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>How to make Pav Bhaji (Instructions for Preparations):</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse, peel and chop the veggies. You will need 1 cup chopped cauliflower, 1 cup chopped carrot, 3 medium sized potatoes (chopped) and â…“ cup chopped french beans.</li> <b>Note: </b> can also add veggies that you like, but do not add okra, eggplants, pumpkin, radish, corn, yam or green leafy vegetables. <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cabbage, broccoli, zucchini, pumpkin are some unique options that you can consider to add, but the traditional version does not include these veggies.
                    <li>Add all the above chopped veggies in a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker. Also add 1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen). <br>&emsp;I have cooked the veggies in a pressure cooker. You can boil or steam them using a pan or in the Instant pot adding water as needed.</li>
